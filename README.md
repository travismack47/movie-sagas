# Movie Sagas

- Created an app that pulls a list of movies from a SQL database and displays the titles and pictures of the movies on the home page.
- When a picture of a movie is clicked, it brings the user to a details page for that movie.
- On the details page, it tells you the title of the movie, the poster picture, the description, and the genre/genres the movie is a part of.
- There is also a home button on the details page which brings the user back to the home page when clicked.

## Time Spent On Project
I spent about 10 hours on this project. The base goals weren't too difficult. A lot of that time was spent messing around with MaterialUI and figuring out how that works. 

## Setting Up Node
First, you will need to install the node installer from their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then, run the installer, and restart your computer when finished. To check if this was successful, open up your terminal and run node -v. A version number should display if installation was successful. Inside VSCode, open the app terminal and run "npm install '' " followed by the package you want to install and use.

## Setting Up Express
You will first need to download and set up Node, then just follow the directions on the Express [website](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) to install and set up/configure.

## Setting Up Postgresql
To install and set up Postgresql on your computer, follow all of the instructions on this [website](https://www.sqlshack.com/setting-up-a-postgresql-database-on-mac/). You will need to run "npm install pg" inside of you VSCode terminal upon starting each project that will be using it.

## Installing 
You will need to open the VSCode terminal up inside of the project and run the command "npm install" to get everything installed that you will be using in this app.

## Starting The Server
Once you have all of your code written to start a live server, open the terminal inside of VSCode and type "npm run server". This should start a live server for you to test things on Postman or inside of your browser.

## Starting The Client
Once you have the server up and running, you will need to open up a second terminal window inside of VSCode and run "npm run client". This will allow both ends to be up and running for you to display and test in the browser.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge and thank the staff and students at Emerging Digital Academy for being great people to work with and being very helpful. If you are stuck on something, they will take their time to help you through it, but also to understand what's happening with the code as well.
